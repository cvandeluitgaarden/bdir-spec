## Abstract

This document specifies the **BDIR Patch Protocol**, a stateless protocol for AI-assisted content review. The protocol constrains AI systems to analyze complete documents while producing block-scoped patch instructions rather than rewritten content. It is designed to support deterministic validation, auditability, and human-in-the-loop workflows in regulated or large-scale content environments.

## 1. Introduction

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled automated analysis and modification of textual content. Most existing approaches rely on direct rewriting of documents, which introduces risks related to unintended semantic changes, lack of auditability, and unsuitability for regulated or safety-critical environments.

The BDIR Patch Protocol defines a different interaction model. Under this protocol, an AI system analyzes a complete document but is restricted to producing a set of deterministic, block-level patch instructions. These instructions can be validated, reviewed, and applied by downstream systems under strict safety constraints.

The protocol is intentionally stateless, AI-agnostic, and independent of any specific content management system. It is designed to enable automation while preserving human oversight and traceability.

---

## 2. Terminology

The key words **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **REQUIRED**, **SHALL**, **SHALL NOT**, **SHOULD**, **SHOULD NOT**, **RECOMMENDED**, **NOT RECOMMENDED**, **MAY**, and **OPTIONAL** in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 (RFC 2119 and RFC 8174).

**BDIR (Block-based Document Intermediate Representation)**  
A canonical representation of a document as an ordered sequence of semantic blocks.

**Edit Packet**  
A minimized derivative of BDIR used as input to an AI system.

**Patch**  
A set of instructions describing proposed modifications to BDIR content.

**Block**  
An atomic unit of content identified by a stable identifier.

## 2.1 JSON Field Naming (Normative)

All JSON field names defined by this specification **MUST** use **snake_case**.

- Implementations **MUST** emit canonical protocol objects using snake_case.
- Other casings (e.g. camelCase) are **non-canonical** and require explicit adapters.

---

## 3. Goals and Non-Goals

### 3.1 Goals

The BDIR Patch Protocol is designed to:

- Enable AI systems to review complete documents while producing scoped, reviewable changes
- Reduce the risk of unintended semantic drift
- Support deterministic validation and application of proposed changes
- Minimize operational cost, including token usage
- Remain compatible with human editorial workflows

### 3.2 Non-Goals

The protocol does not aim to:

- Enable real-time collaborative editing
- Automatically resolve conflicting edits
- Replace human editorial judgment
- Define content extraction or segmentation algorithms
- Guarantee correctness of AI-proposed changes

---

## 4. Protocol Model

An AI system participating in this protocol **MUST** be treated as an untrusted proposer. All outputs produced by the AI **MUST** be validated prior to application. No assumption is made regarding the correctness, intent, or reliability of the AI system.

The protocol separates **analysis** (performed by the AI) from **application** (performed by a downstream system under validation).

---

## 5. BDIR Overview (Informative)

BDIR represents a document as an ordered list of semantic blocks. Each block has:

- a stable identifier
- a semantic classification
- canonical text content
- a content hash

BDIR is format-agnostic. While Markdown is commonly used as the canonical text encoding, the protocol does not require a specific markup language.

### 5.1 BDIR document metadata (Normative)

Implementations commonly store and exchange a **BDIR document** (the full, authoritative representation from which an Edit Packet is derived).

While this RFC standardizes the **Edit Packet** wire format for AI input, interoperability requires a clear contract for the minimal **top-level metadata** that a BDIR document MUST carry.

#### 5.1.1 Required top-level fields

A BDIR document **MUST** include the following top-level fields:

- `version` (integer)
  - Protocol major version of the BDIR document envelope.
  - For the protocol defined in this RFC, `version` **MUST** be `1`.

- `url` (string)
  - Canonical source identifier for the document (typically an absolute URL).
  - `url` **MUST** be stable for the lifetime of the extracted content.
  - **Note (non-normative):** If an absolute URL is unavailable, implementations may use a stable URN-like identifier.

- `hash_algorithm` (string)
  - Identifier for the hash algorithm used for any document-level and block-level hashes (including page hashes and block `text_hash` values).

These fields are required even when a downstream system chooses to operate primarily on Edit Packets.

#### 5.1.2 Accepted `hash_algorithm` values

For interoperability, implementations **MUST** support the following baseline value:

- `"sha256"` — SHA-256, represented as lowercase hex.

Implementations **MAY** support additional values for `hash_algorithm`. If additional algorithms are supported, they:

- **MUST** be identified by a stable, lowercase token (e.g. `"xxh64"`, `"blake3"`).
- **MUST** produce deterministic outputs for identical canonical input bytes.

If a receiver does not recognize `hash_algorithm`, it **MUST** treat the document as unsupported and **MUST NOT** attempt to apply patches derived from it.

#### 5.1.3 Relationship to Edit Packet `ha`

The Edit Packet field `ha` is the wire-format counterpart of the BDIR document’s `hash_algorithm`:

- When an Edit Packet is derived from a BDIR document, `ha` **MUST** equal the document’s `hash_algorithm`.
- If `ha` is omitted in an Edit Packet, receivers **MUST** treat it as `"sha256"` (see Section 6.3).

#### 5.1.4 `text_hash` truncation semantics

Implementations often truncate hashes in Edit Packets to reduce token usage.

- In a full BDIR document, any block `text_hash` value **SHOULD** be the full, untruncated lowercase-hex digest for the configured `hash_algorithm`.
- In an Edit Packet, `h` and per-block `text_hash` values **MAY** be represented as a truncated **prefix** of the full digest.
- If truncation is used, the value **MUST** be a prefix of the full digest, and the prefix length **MUST** be at least 8 hex characters.

Receivers **MUST NOT** assume that a hash value is untruncated unless its length matches the expected digest length for the declared algorithm.

> **Non-normative note**
>
> Truncation increases the probability of collisions. Implementations that rely on hashes for binding or security properties should prefer full digests and treat truncated values as optimization-only identifiers.

## 6. Edit Packet

### 6.1 Purpose

The Edit Packet provides sufficient document context for AI-assisted review while minimizing token usage. It is derived from BDIR and is not intended to be a complete or lossless serialization.

### 6.2 Wire Format

The Edit Packet is encoded as a JSON object:

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "tid": "string (optional)",
  "h": "contentHash",
  "ha": "hash_algorithm",
  "b": [
    ["block_id", kind_code, "text_hash", "text"]
  ]
}
```

### 6.3 Field Semantics

- `v`  
  Protocol version. This document defines version `1`.

- `tid`  
  Optional trace identifier. This value MAY be used by implementations to associate the packet with external metadata such as a URL or retrieval timestamp.

- `h`  
  Page-level content hash. This value MUST match the hash of the BDIR content used to generate the packet, computed using the algorithm specified by `ha` (or the default baseline when `ha` is omitted).

- `ha`  
  Hash algorithm identifier for `h` and block-level `text_hash` values.

  **Interoperability requirement:** Implementations **MUST** support `"sha256"` as a baseline algorithm. Implementations MAY support additional algorithms via `ha`.

  **Defaulting rule:** If `ha` is omitted, receivers **MUST** treat it as `"sha256"`.

  **Intent note (non-normative):** Hashes are primarily for deterministic equality / binding and validation. They are not, by themselves, a claim of cryptographic security.

- `b`  
  An ordered list of block tuples representing the document content.

### 6.4 Block Tuple

Each block tuple has the following structure:

```
[block_id, kind_code, text_hash, text]
```

- `block_id` MUST be stable across extractions
- `text_hash` MUST correspond to the provided `text`
- `text` MUST represent the canonical block content

---

## 7. kind_code Semantics

The `kind_code` field communicates block importance rather than presentation details.

### 7.1 Importance Ranges

| Range | Semantics |
|------|-----------|
| 0–19 | Core content or structure |
| 20–39 | Boilerplate or navigation |
| 40–59 | User interface chrome |
| 99 | Unknown |

AI systems SHOULD avoid proposing modifications to lower-importance blocks unless clear errors are present.

---

## 8. Patch Instructions

### 8.0 Patch wire format (Normative)

A Patch is encoded as a JSON object:

```json
{
  "v": 1,
  "h": "page_content_hash",
  "ha": "sha256",
  "ops": [
    { "op": "replace", "block_id": "p1", "before": "teh", "after": "the" }
  ]
}
```

Field semantics:

- `v` (integer)
  - Patch version. This RFC defines version `1`.

- `h` (string)
  - Page-level content hash binding for the patch.
  - `h` **MUST** equal the Edit Packet `h` value the AI analyzed when producing
    the patch.

- `ha` (string, OPTIONAL)
  - Hash algorithm identifier for `h`.
  - If omitted, receivers **MUST** treat it as `"sha256"`.

- `ops` (array)
  - Ordered list of patch operations.

### 8.1 General Rules

AI systems **MUST** output patch instructions rather than rewritten documents.

### 8.2 Supported Operations

The protocol defines the following operation types:

- `replace`
- `delete`
- `insert_after`
- `suggest`

### 8.2.1 `replace` operation semantics

`replace` is a mutating operation that replaces an exact substring within an
existing block.

Required fields:

- `op`: the literal string `"replace"`
- `block_id`: the target block identifier
- `before`: the exact substring expected to exist within the target block text
- `after`: replacement text

Optional fields:

- `occurrence` (integer, 1-indexed)
  - Used to disambiguate multiple matches of `before` within a single block.

If `occurrence` is omitted and `before` matches more than once within the target
block, receivers **SHOULD** reject the patch as ambiguous.

### 8.2.2 `delete` operation semantics

`delete` is a mutating operation that removes an exact substring within an
existing block.

Required fields:

- `op`: the literal string `"delete"`
- `block_id`: the target block identifier
- `before`: the exact substring to delete

Optional fields:

- `occurrence` (integer, 1-indexed)
  - Used to disambiguate multiple matches of `before` within a single block.

If `occurrence` is omitted and `before` matches more than once within the target
block, receivers **SHOULD** reject the patch as ambiguous.

### 8.2.3 `insert_after` operation semantics

`insert_after` is a mutating operation that inserts a **new block** immediately
after an existing block.

Required fields:

- `op`: the literal string `"insert_after"`
- `block_id`: the existing block after which the new block is inserted
- `new_block_id`: identifier for the inserted block (MUST be unique within the
  document)
- `kind_code`: kind classification for the inserted block
- `text`: canonical text content for the inserted block

`insert_after` operations **MUST NOT** include `before` or `after` fields.

### 8.2.4 `suggest` operation semantics

The `suggest` operation is **non-mutating** and **advisory**. It exists to carry human-readable review notes that do not deterministically apply changes.

An operation with `op: "suggest"`:

- MUST be scoped to an existing block via `block_id`
- MUST NOT modify BDIR content
- MUST be safe to ignore (a receiver MAY drop all `suggest` operations without violating this protocol)
- MUST remain bound to the page-level hash and validation rules that govern the patch as a whole

#### `suggest` fields

`suggest` operations MUST include:

- `op`: the literal string `"suggest"`
- `block_id`: the target block identifier
- `message`: a human-readable advisory note

`suggest` operations MAY include:

- `severity`: one of `low`, `medium`, `high` (non-normative; receivers MAY ignore)

`suggest` operations MUST NOT include `before` or `after` fields.

### 8.3 Validation Requirements

All patch instructions:

- MUST reference an existing `block_id`
- MUST be validated prior to application

For `replace` and `delete` operations:

- An exact `before` substring MUST be provided
- The substring MUST match verbatim within the target block text

For `insert_after` operations:

- `block_id` MUST reference an existing block
- `new_block_id` MUST be present and MUST NOT conflict with any existing block
  identifier in the target document
- `kind_code` MUST be present
- `text` MUST be present
- `before` and `after` MUST NOT be present

For `suggest` operations:

- `block_id` MUST reference an existing block
- `message` MUST be present
- `before` and `after` MUST NOT be present

Receivers MAY ignore or drop all `suggest` operations without violating this protocol.

Failure of any validation step **MUST** result in rejection of the entire patch.
### 8.4 Canonical operation ordering (Determinism)

Patch `ops` arrays have no semantic ordering requirement in this RFC; however, implementations **SHOULD** canonicalize operation ordering before storing, hashing, caching, diffing, or displaying patches. Canonical ordering reduces review noise and enables deterministic cache keys.

When canonicalizing, implementations **SHOULD** sort operations by:

1. `block_id` ascending (lexicographic), or by the block's document order when the source Edit Packet is available
2. Operation type in this order: `delete`, `replace`, `insert_after`, `suggest`
3. Operation-specific fields (`before`, `after`, `text`, `message`, `occurrence`)

If any ties remain, implementations **SHOULD** apply a deterministic tie-breaker (e.g., original index).

## 9. Patch Application

A patch MUST only be applied if all of the following conditions are met:

1. The page-level content hash matches
2. All referenced blocks exist
3. All `before` substrings match exactly

The **page-level content hash** match requirement means:

- The receiver MUST compute (or otherwise obtain) the current page-level content
  hash for the target document using the algorithm specified by the patch `ha`
  (defaulting to "sha256").
- The receiver MUST compare that current value to the patch `h`.
- If the values do not match, the receiver **MUST** reject the patch.

Implementations MUST treat patch application as an all-or-nothing operation.

`suggest` operations MUST NOT be applied as mutations and MUST NOT participate in patch application.

Implementations MAY discard `suggest` operations prior to application; doing so MUST NOT change the resulting document state.

---

## 10. Caching and Deduplication

Implementations SHOULD cache patch results using a deterministic key derived from:

- the AI model identifier
- the prompt or instruction version
- the patch schema version
- a hash of the Edit Packet

Identical inputs SHOULD result in identical patches.

---

## 11. Telemetry

Implementations SHOULD record operational telemetry, including:

- input token count
- output token count
- total token count
- cache hit or miss status

Telemetry data MAY be used for auditing, cost analysis, and operational monitoring.

---

## 12. Security Considerations

The protocol enforces safety through structural constraints rather than behavioral assumptions. Implementations MUST validate all patches prior to application.

This protocol does not prevent AI systems from proposing incorrect or undesirable changes; instead, it ensures that such changes are detectable, reviewable, and rejectable before application.

---

## 13. Related Work

The BDIR Patch Protocol is related to, but distinct from, existing mechanisms such as JSON Patch (RFC 6902), operational transformation systems, editorial suggestion workflows, and AI text rewriting APIs. These systems either lack semantic awareness, deterministic validation, or suitability for automated and regulated environments.

---

## 14. Call for Comments

Feedback is invited from implementers, content platform maintainers, and AI system integrators. In particular, feedback is requested on:

- the sufficiency of the Edit Packet format
- validation and safety mechanisms
- interoperability across content extraction pipelines
- operational experience at scale

Such feedback will inform future revisions of this document.
