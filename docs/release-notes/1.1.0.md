# Release Notes — v1.1.0

Date: 2026-01-22

This release adds **non-breaking protocol extensions** to RFC-0001 within major version v1.

## Additions

- `insert_before`: insert a new block immediately **before** an existing block.
- `replace_block`: replace the entire canonical text of an existing block (optionally updating `kind_code`).
- `delete_block`: remove an existing block entirely.
- Optional `rationale` field on operations (advisory only; must not affect validation or application).
- Empty patch semantics: `ops: []` is valid and represents “reviewed with no changes”.

## Compatibility

- Patch wire `v` remains `1`.
- Existing v1 patches remain valid.

## Implementation notes (non-normative)

- Validators should reject conflicting operations that target the same `block_id` (e.g., `delete_block` combined with other edits on the same block).
- Canonical ordering guidance is extended to include the new operation types.
