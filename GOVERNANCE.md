# Governance

This document describes the lightweight governance model for the BDIR Patch Protocol.

The goal of this model is to balance openness with clear stewardship and long-term stability.

---

## Maintainers

The project is stewarded by one or more **maintainers**.

Maintainers are responsible for:
- Curating and evolving the specification
- Reviewing and merging pull requests
- Managing releases and versioning
- Ensuring consistency across RFC, schemas, and examples

---

## Decision making

- Maintainers have final decision authority.
- Decisions are guided by technical merit, safety, and interoperability.
- Significant changes should be discussed publicly via issues.

The absence of a formal vote is intentional; consensus is preferred, but not required.

---

## Specification stability

The maintainers aim to:
- Preserve backward compatibility within a major version
- Avoid unnecessary churn
- Clearly communicate breaking changes

Stability is considered a core value of the protocol.

---

## Relationship to standards bodies

This project may inform or evolve into a formal standard in the future.
Until then, this repository serves as the canonical reference for the BDIR Patch Protocol.

---

## Forks and independent implementations

Independent implementations are encouraged.

Forks are free to evolve independently, but only this repository defines the canonical specification and versioning of the BDIR Patch Protocol.

---

## Changes to governance

This governance model may evolve over time.
Changes to this document require maintainer approval.
