      "body": "## Problem\n\nThe current patch application process does not enforce a binding between a patch and the exact page content it was derived from. This means a patch may still apply even if the underlying page has changed in subtle but meaningful ways.\n\n## Why this matters\n\nWithout page-level content binding:\n\n- Patches may apply to stale or mutated documents\n- Validation may succeed while semantic intent is violated\n- Deterministic replay of patches cannot be guaranteed\n\nThis weakens the safety guarantees of the engine.\n\n## Proposed direction\n\nIntroduce an **optional page-level hash binding** that:\n\n- Computes a stable hash of the normalized source content\n- Embeds this hash into the patch metadata\n- Rejects patch application when the hash does not match\n\nThe mechanism must be:\n\n- Deterministic\n- Explicitly opt-in\n- Compatible with future patch versions\n\n## Acceptance criteria\n\n- [ ] Page-level content hash can be generated deterministically\n- [ ] Patch metadata can optionally include the hash\n- [ ] Patch application fails fast on hash mismatch\n- [ ] Failure mode produces a clear diagnostic\n- [ ] No behavior change when feature is disabled\n\n## Notes\n\nThis is a safety hardening measure and should be treated as a high-priority fix."
